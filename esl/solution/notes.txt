1. For Verilator and CMake

If error occurs like the following:
"""
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:46 (target_link_libraries):
  The keyword signature for target_link_libraries has already been used with
  the target "example".  All uses of target_link_libraries with a target must
  be either all-keyword or all-plain.

  The uses of the keyword signature are here:

   * /usr/local/share/verilator/verilator-config.cmake:341 (target_link_libraries)
"""

You can use the following command to open the corresponding file:
$ sudo vim /usr/local/share/verilator/verilator-config.cmake

Then locate the corresponding line and comment out the related "target_link_libraries" statement.
